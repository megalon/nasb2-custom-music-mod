_____

## üöÄ Installation

This project requires [SlimeModdingUtilities](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/SlimeModdingUtilities)

## ‚Ñπ Usage

For basic usage see the simple format shown below.

### Folder structure
```
BepInEx
    ‚Ü≥ CustomSongs
        ‚Ü≥ Menus
            ‚Ü≥ MainMenu
            ‚Ü≥ OnlineMenu
              ...
        ‚Ü≥ Stages
            ‚Ü≥ Angry Beavers Dam
            ‚Ü≥ Bun Wrestling Ring
              ...
```

Place `.wav`, `.ogg`, or `.mp3` files into the folder corresponding to the stage or menu you want to change.

For example, if you want to use a different song for the Jellyfish Fields stage, place the audio file in `BepInEx\CustomSongs\Stages\Jellyfish Fields`

If multiple audio files are in the same folder, one is randomly selected each time that stage / menu is loaded!

## ‚ùî FAQ

### "My .mp3 didn't work!"
I've had multiple people unable to load certain mp3 files.

If you've downloaded a file from a youtube downloader, such as `ytmp3.cc`, your file might actually be an `.m4a` disguised as a `.mp3`

Unity cannot load these (it seems).

Use a different converter, or convert to `.ogg` instead! Thanks.

### "What happens if I have multiple songs in the same folder?"

The mod will randomly select a song to play each time that stage / menu / victory is loaded.

### "Can I include the default songs in the random selection?"

Yes. You must enable the option in the config file. See *Configuration* above.

## üîß Developing

This project requires [SlimeModdingUtilities](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/SlimeModdingUtilities)

### Setup

Clone the project, then create a file in the root of the project directory named:

`NickCustomMusicMod.csproj.user`

Here you need to set the `GameDir` property to match your install directory.

Example:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <GameDir>D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl</GameDir>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Now when you build the mod, it should resolve your references automatically, and the build event will copy the plugin into your `BepInEx\plugins` folder!
